Here’s a screenshot of my browser. You can see the result of my work.
I’m not really sure what else to write, so let’s leave it at that.

## My process

I was really lost at first and didn’t know where to start. I used Grid for everything related to the body and Flexbox to organize the card itself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

```css
.attribution a {
  color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);
}
```

use hsl(h:'hue', s:'saturation', l:'lightness') for color.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I’m not used to concepts like Grid and Flexbox, so this was a great opportunity to strengthen my understanding of them. I also learned more about organizing my HTML code — especially with tags, classes, and so on. I discovered new CSS properties and got a better grasp of how everything fits together. So I’m really happy about it.

## Acknowledgments

The project was inspired by Frontend Mentor. It’s a site I just discovered. I recently finished learning HTML and CSS, so I needed to strengthen my skills. Thanks to Frontend Mentor and its many ready-made project ideas, I just have to start coding, and that’s it. I have a base visual to follow and can build from there. Thank you so much — this platform is going to help me a lot.
